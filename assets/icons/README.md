# Custom Icons

Custom icons are generated at https://icomoon.io/app/#/select/font.

If you need to modify these icons, go over that site, import the
icon project with `selection.json` that is in the same directory
with this README. After that, you can make modifications to these.

For detailed information, check over "Icomoon" section of this
